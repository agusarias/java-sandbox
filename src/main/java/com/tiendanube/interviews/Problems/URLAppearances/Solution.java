 * Tienda Nube Interview
 * Coding exercise
 *
 * Step 1:
 * Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given url in an
 * array of N urls. You can assume that this method will be called once.
 *
 * Step 2:
 * If the method is going to be called multiple times, which changes would you
 * make to make it faster?
